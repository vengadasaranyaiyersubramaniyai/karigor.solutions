# Karigor Smart AI Teacher Cloud API Documentation

## Overview
The Karigor Smart AI Teacher Cloud API allows you to integrate Nvidia Jarvis-powered AI teacher functionality into your own learning management system (LMS) or educational applications. With this API, you can provide personalized, AI-driven teaching experiences to your users, enhancing their learning outcomes and engagement.

## Getting Started
To use the Karigor Smart AI Teacher Cloud API, follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up:**
   If you haven't already, sign up for access to the Karigor Smart AI Teacher Cloud API on our website.

2. **Authentication:**
   Once you have signed up, you will receive an API key. Include this API key in your API requests for authentication.

3. **Integration:**
   Integrate the API into your LMS or application by sending HTTP requests to the API endpoints.

4. **Sending Messages:**
   To interact with the AI teacher, send a POST request to the `/api/chat` endpoint with the user's message as the request body. The API will return a response containing the AI teacher's reply.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/chat:**
  - Description: Send a message to the AI teacher and receive a response.
  - Request Body:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "User's message goes here"
    }
    ```
  - Response Body:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "AI teacher's response"
    }
    ```

## Example Usage
Here's an example of how to use the API in Python using the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
base_url = 'http://localhost:5000/api/chat'  # Update with your API URL

def send_message(message):
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'}
    data = {'message': message}
    response = requests.post(base_url, json=data, headers=headers)
    return response.json()['message']

# Example usage
user_message = input("Enter your message: ")
response = send_message(user_message)
print("AI Teacher:", response)


#Notes:

#Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key.
#Update base_url with the URL of your API endpoint.
#Make sure to handle errors and exceptions in your application code.
